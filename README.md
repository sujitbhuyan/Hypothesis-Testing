Problem Statement: E-Bike is Indiaâ€™s leading micro-mobility service provider, offering unique vehicles for daily commutes. Starting as a mission to eliminate traffic congestion in India, E-Bike provides the safest commute solution through a user-friendly mobile app, enabling shared, solo, and sustainable commuting.

E-Bike zones are strategically located at key locations, including metro stations, bus stands, office spaces, residential areas, corporate offices, and more, to ensure that the first and last miles of travel are smooth, affordable, and convenient.

Recently, E-Bike has experienced significant declines in revenue. To address this issue, they have contracted a consulting company to analyze the factors influencing the demand for their shared electric cycles in the Indian market.
